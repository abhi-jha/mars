mars
====

mars is a graph layout tool for large graph visualization. By constructing a low-rank approximation to the all-pairs shortest path matrx, mars can compute stress majorization based layouts on graphs with several hundred thousand nodes. This is well beyond the limits of standard stress majorziation based layout algorithms, such as those found in neato. It is based on the work in [Drawing Large Graphs by Low-Rank Stress Majorization](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~khoury/mars.pdf).
